# Day 3

## Info - Openshift S2I 
<pre>
- Unlike Kubernetes, Openshift apart from deploying application from readily available or pre-built custom docker image, one could deploy application from source code from your version control
- S2I stands for Source to Image, i.e Openshift will build the custom image based on your application source code
- Openshift S2I supports many different strategies
  1. Docker
  2. Source
  3. Custom
  4. Pipeline(Jenkins/TekTon)
  5. Binary(S2I Binary)
</pre>

## Info - Openshift S2I Docker Strategy
<pre>
- You will have to provide your Version control url, for example - https://github.com/tektutor/spring-ms.git
- The GitHub url should have your application source code and Dockerfile
- BuildConfig will be autogenerated by Openshift
- Application will be build to create application binary, using your application binary it will create a custom image as per your instructions in the Dockerfile
- the custom image built will then be pushed into Openshift Internal Image Registry
- It will then deploy your application using the image it pushed into Openshift Internal Image Registry
- It will automatically create BuildConfig and ImageStream, Deployment and Service
- You need to expose the source to creeate a route ( a public url to access the application )
  oc expose svc/hello
- You can then access the application using the route url from command-line or from the web console
</pre>

## Lab - Deploying the application using S2I docker strategy
```
oc delete project jegan
oc new-project jegan

oc new-app --name=hello https://github.com/tektutor/spring-ms.git --strategy=docker
oc expose svc/hello

oc logs -f bc/hello
```

## Lab - Deploying the application using S2I source strategy
```
oc delete project jegan
oc new-project jegan

oc new-app --name=hello registry.access.redhat.com/ubi8/openjdk-17~https://github.com/tektutor/spring-ms.git --strategy=source
oc expose svc/hello

oc logs -f bc/hello
```
